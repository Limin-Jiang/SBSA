# SBSA
Somatic Binding Sequence Analysis 

Somatic Binding Sequence Analyzer (SBSA) is developed as the first full-capacity online tool to detect somatic alterations in binding motifs of transcription factors (TFs), RNA-binding proteins, miRNA seeds, and miRNA-mRNA 3â€™UTR binding target et al.

The code is based on python!

input file:

a mutation file in CVS format including five columns. 
The first column reprsents the chromsome name of species or name for SARS genomes. 
The second column reprsents the location of somatic mutation/SNP in genomes. 
The third column reprsents the reference nucleotide of mutation site. 
The forth and fifth columns reprsent the two mutation/SNP nucleotide of mutation site. 
Additional, altered binding sequences can arise from single nucleotide mutations, insertion, deletion, RNA editing, or SNP. Additional, Four projects were supported in this web. A sample file was supplied in below. Where, "-" symbol in sample file reprsents deletion.


The code needs the fasta file for species genomic For example: GRCH37,GRCH38,GRCm37,GRCm38.
